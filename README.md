- Please DO NOT SEND COINS to this address

- Fixation of arbitrary information in the blockchain ALWAYS DESTROYS a fraction of bitcoins!!!

- Usage of KeyBits AT YOUR OWN RISK

(ii) Reading gpg keyring using blockchain.info

```
john@skynet$ java -jar KeyBits.jar -i 1Pmbtsb5Wm2ivE1KTnRXtpkR5oRprUAccz

(iii) Reading gpg keyring from p2p-network directly

The following command will read the gpg-keyring directly from the p2p-network. Therefore,
KeyBits needs to know the hash of the block where the gpg-keyring generating transaction
is fixed as well as the hash of this transaction. This command will produce a new wallet
and blockchain  file (main.wallet and main.wallet.chain),  which are only  necessary for
bitcoinj to work. You can delete them, but  keeping them might advantageous. The program
will produce a lot of additional output generated by bitcoinj.

```
john@skynet$ java -jar KeyBits.jar -i 00000000000000001144cf4bfc3c0424f60f6074466586a0d56bd6e7bfb3a6f2,9cd86f49366a460431f0f5d9fd889c9d4f0f776213f3a1c4d26fc2cbc2446660

(iv) Importing gpg keyring using blockchain.info

```
john@skynet$ java -jar KeyBits.jar -i 1Pmbtsb5Wm2ivE1KTnRXtpkR5oRprUAccz | gpg --armor --import
```
(v) Importing gpg keyring from p2p-network directly

```
john@skynet$ java -jar KeyBits.jar -i 00000000000000001144cf4bfc3c0424f60f6074466586a0d56bd6e7bfb3a6f2,9cd86f49366a460431f0f5d9fd889c9d4f0f776213f3a1c4d26fc2cbc2446660 2> /dev/null | gpg --armor --import
```

(vi) Exporting gpg keyring

```
john@skynet$ gpg --armor --export <email@provider.com> | java -jar KeyBits.jar -e
```

This will export the gpg keyring associated with  the email address <email@provider.com>.
therefore, KeyBits creates  and/or updates  a new wallet associated  with this key which
will contain exactly one address. This wallet  will be encrypted by default, so the user
must choose and remember a password. Also the corresponding chain file is created and/or
updated.  Not the  total blockchain  needs to be  downloaded if the  checkpoint  file is
available. It  is then  checked, if the address  contains  enough  funds  to fix the gpg
keyring  into the  blockchain. If not, the user is asked to send the corrsponding amount
of  XBT to the single  address and the  program exits exists  immediately. Otherwise, if
there are enough founds, KeyBits will fix the keyring into the blockchain and wait until
the transaction is fixed in the blockchain with depth 1.

VERY IMPORTANT: YOU MUST KEEP THE WALLET FILE WHICH IS CREATED  DURING EXPORT AS WELL AS
THE CORRESPONDING PASSWORD!

This is  important, since a second  outgoing transaction marks the gpg keyring  as being
not trustworthy anymore.

(vii) Sending coins

```
john@skynet$ java -jar KeyBits.jar -s <wallet file> -a <address> -n <# of satoshis>
```

The wallet files are named ```<something>.wallet``` and the chain files are named
```<something>.wallet.chain```. If you use the bitcoinj functionality, you might want to
suppress the error stream via

```
john@skynet$ java -jar KeyBits.jar -s <wallet file> -a <address> -n <# of satoshis> 2> error.stream
```

You then should check file ```error.stream``` for helpful information if something goes wrong.
